# Bitcoin Brute-Force Key Checker with Email Notification

## Introduction

This project is a Python tool designed to search for Bitcoin private keys that match a given list of known public wallet addresses. When a matching key is found, it automatically encrypts the key information and sends it via email to the user as a password-protected attachment. The tool is developed with multi-threading capabilities to maximize CPU resource utilization and accelerate the search process.

**Important Note:** Finding random Bitcoin private keys for existing wallet addresses is astronomically difficult due to the vast key space. This project is primarily for educational and experimental purposes and does not guarantee finding any keys.

## Key Features

  * **Bitcoin Key Search:** Randomly generates private keys and checks their corresponding public addresses against a target list of wallet addresses.
  * **Multi-threading:** Leverages multiple processing threads (CPU cores) to speed up address checking.
  * **Secure Email Notification:** Upon finding a matching key:
      * Key information (public address and private key) is written to a local file (`foundkey.txt`).
      * This sensitive information is encrypted using `openssl` and attached to an email.
      * The email is sent to the configured recipient address.
  * **Progress Tracking:** Updates a count file (`count.txt`) with the cumulative number of addresses checked for continuous progress monitoring.
  * **Virtual Environment:** Utilizes a Python virtual environment for clean dependency management.
  * **Automated Setup Script:** Includes a shell script (`full_setup.sh`) to prepare the Linux environment (installing `openssl`, Python `venv`, Python libraries) and download project files from GitHub.

```

## System Requirements

  * Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu/Debian or similar).
  * `openssl` installed.
  * `python3` and `python3-venv` installed.
  * Internet connection (for sending emails and downloading dependencies).

## Usage Guide

### 1\. System Setup and Project Download

1.  **Download the setup script:** Download the `full_setup.sh` file to your machine.
2.  **Grant executable permissions:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved `full_setup.sh`.
    ```bash
    chmod +x full_setup.sh
    ```
3.  **Run the setup script:** This script will automatically install system dependencies, create the Python virtual environment, and download all project files into the `btc_brute_force` directory.
    ```bash
    sudo ./full_setup.sh
    ```
      * The script will prompt you for your user password for `sudo`.
      * During execution, it will automatically `cd` into the `btc_brute_force` directory.
      * Upon completion, the Python virtual environment will be activated (you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt).

### 2\. Configure `script.py`

After `full_setup.sh` completes, you will be in the `btc_brute_force` directory.
You need to edit the `script.py` file to fill in your email information:

1.  Open `script.py` with a text editor (e.g., `nano script.py` or `vim script.py`).

2.  Find the `Email configuration` section and fill in your details:

    ```python
    # Email configuration (IMPORTANT: REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN INFO and KEEP CONFIDENTIAL)
    SMTP_USER = 'your_email@gmail.com'          # REPLACE WITH YOUR GMAIL ADDRESS
    SMTP_PASSWORD = 'your_app_password'     # REPLACE WITH YOUR GMAIL APP PASSWORD
    RECIPIENT_EMAIL = 'your_recipient_email@example.com' # REPLACE WITH THE EMAIL TO RECEIVE ALERTS

    # Encryption/Decryption Password (VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT SHARE THIS PASSWORD PUBLICLY!)
    ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD = "YOUR_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD" # REPLACE THIS WITH A STRONG PASSWORD. KEEP IT PRIVATE!
    ```

      * **`SMTP_USER`**: Your Gmail address that will be used to send emails.
      * **`SMTP_PASSWORD`**: This **must** be an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=vi) generated from your Google account, **NOT** your regular Gmail password.
      * **`RECIPIENT_EMAIL`**: The email address where you want to receive key discovery notifications.
      * **`ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`**: A strong password that you will use to encrypt the key information. **Remember this password\!** You'll need it to decrypt the email attachment.

3.  Save the `script.py` file.

### 3\. Prepare `riches.txt` File

Create or edit the `riches.txt` file in the `btc_brute_force` directory. Each line in this file should contain one public Bitcoin wallet address that you wish to check against.

**Example `riches.txt`:**

```
1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa
1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendfGhsDr
1FeexV6bAHb8ybCbsHRcpxRxW6MZmPnMpS
# ... add more addresses
```

### 4\. Run the Main Script

Ensure you are still in the `btc_brute_force` directory and the virtual environment is active (you see `(venv)`).

```bash
python script.py
```

The script will begin generating and checking addresses. Progress will be printed to the terminal. If a matching address is found, an email will be sent with the `found_key.enc` file attached, and the program will exit.

### 5\. Decrypting the `found_key.enc` File

Once you receive the email with the `found_key.enc` attachment, download it to a machine where you have `openssl` and the `decrypt.py` script.

1.  **Download `found_key.enc`:** Download the attachment from your email to your computer/server (e.g., into the `btc_brute_force` directory).
2.  **Run the decryption script:**
    ```bash
    python decrypt.py
    ```
3.  The script will prompt you for the path to the encrypted file and then for the decryption password (which is the `ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` you set in `script.py`).
    ```
    Enter the path to the encrypted file (e.g., /path/to/found_key.enc): found_key.enc
    Enter the decryption password: YOUR_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD
    ```
    The decrypted content (public address and private key) will then be displayed on your screen.
